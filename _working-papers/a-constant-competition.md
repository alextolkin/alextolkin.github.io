### Abstract:
Why do some people see opportunities for cooperation while others believe a situation is inherently competitive? While most research has examined people seeing group relationships as zero-sum in a particular context, in this study I examine the causes and consequences of seeing the world as zero-sum in general. I show that generalized zero-sum predicts thinking policies are zero sum for a variety of policy areas. I then show that priming people to think about sports - a competition largely unrelated to politics - makes people view the world as more zero-sum. I conclude by discussing how the competition is primed in many media contexts.
