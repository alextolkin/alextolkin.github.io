### Abstract:
After the 2020 US presidential election, many of Donald Trump’s supporters blamed his loss on failures in the election process. Why did some of Trump’s supporters accept their candidate’s defeat, while others viewed it as illegitimate? I examine the influence of legitimating rituals, regular displays that promote perceptions that a competition was conducted fairly. Building on social learning theory, I propose a theory for how legitimating rituals in even ostensibly apolitical competitions influence perceptions of whether political competitions were conducted fairly. This theory suggests that watching team sports promotes perceptions that elections are conducted fairly. I test this theoretical prediction in two studies. In the first study I use a nationally representative panel from before and after the 2020 election to examine changes in beliefs about the election. I find that people who watched team sports more increased their perceptions that the election was conducted fairly, relative to those who watched team sports less. This relationship was driven by reactions of Trump supporters to the election. While their perceptions of fairness decreased after Trump’s electoral defeat, perceptions among Trump supporters who watched more team sports decreased significantly less.  In the second study, I test whether legitimating rituals in sports cause people to view political competitions as more legitimate. Using a preregistered survey experiment, I find that watching a sports post-game conference where the loser concedes defeat increases perception that an unrelated election loss was fair. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings not only for studies of election legitimacy, but on studies of the influence of “apolitical” entertainment media on political beliefs.
