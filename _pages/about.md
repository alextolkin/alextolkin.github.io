I'm a joint PhD candidate in political science and communication at University of Pennsylvania studying American political behavior. I focus on media effects, public opinion, and quantitative methods.

My dissertation studies the influence of watching sports on political attitudes and beliefs. I look at the common portrayal of competition in sports: A zero-sum struggle between opposing sides, where the superior side wins and the losing side accepts defeat. I study how this common portrayal influences political attitudes among those who frequently watch sports.
